Initial Setup:
* After adding the Spring security dependency we can go to "SecurityProperties.java" to check the default implementation. Here User is hardcoded and password is randomly generated UUID.
 
* We can assign our own properties by using the prefix defined at class level inside "@ConfigProperties(prefix="spring.security")", after the prefix we need to add the class name i.e User and then the variable name.
Ex - 
spring.security.user.name=${SECURITY_USERNAME:batman}
spring.security.user.password=${SECURITY_PASSWORD:darknight}
